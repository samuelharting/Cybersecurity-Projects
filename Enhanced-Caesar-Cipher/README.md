# üîê Enhanced Caesar Cipher

A modern, professional web-based encryption/decryption tool implementing the classic Caesar cipher with enhanced cybersecurity features and a sleek user interface.

## üìã Overview

This project provides a secure, user-friendly implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm with modern web technologies. It features a responsive design, drag-and-drop functionality, and security-focused features like automatic input clearing.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption**: Shift letters by a configurable amount (1-25 positions)
- **Character Preservation**: Numbers, spaces, and special characters remain unchanged
- **Case Sensitivity**: Maintains original letter case (uppercase/lowercase)
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for shift values and text input

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Professional cybersecurity-themed design with gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop text files or text content directly into the input area
- **Quick Examples**: Pre-loaded example texts for easy testing
- **Auto-Clear**: Automatically clears sensitive input after encryption/decryption
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of results with visual feedback

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on Mac): Encrypt text
- `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (or `Cmd+Shift+Enter` on Mac): Decrypt text

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open `enhanced-caesar-cipher.html` in any modern web browser
2. Enter your text in the input field
3. Set your desired shift value (1-25)
4. Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button
5. Copy the result using the "Copy Result" button

### Advanced Usage
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop text files (.txt) or selected text directly into the input area
- **Quick Examples**: Click on example buttons to populate the input field
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use keyboard shortcuts for faster operation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Algorithm Implementation
The Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet:
- **Encryption**: Each letter is shifted forward by the specified amount
- **Decryption**: Each letter is shifted backward by the specified amount (or forward by 26-shift)
- **Wrapping**: Letters wrap around the alphabet (Z ‚Üí A for forward shifts)

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Security Features
- **Client-Side Processing**: All encryption happens locally in the browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Text never leaves your device
- **Auto-Clear**: Input is automatically cleared after processing
- **Secure Context**: Uses modern Clipboard API when available

## üîß Installation

No installation required! This is a standalone HTML file that runs in any web browser.

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `enhanced-caesar-cipher.html` in your preferred web browser
3. Start encrypting/decrypting immediately

## üéØ Example Usage

### Basic Encryption
- **Input**: "HELLO WORLD"
- **Shift**: 3
- **Output**: "KHOOR ZRUOG"

### Basic Decryption
- **Input**: "KHOOR ZRUOG"
- **Shift**: 3
- **Output**: "HELLO WORLD"

### Mixed Content
- **Input**: "Test123! Special chars"
- **Shift**: 5
- **Output**: "Yjxy123! Xujhfnq hfwmx"

## üîí Security Considerations

While the Caesar cipher is educational and fun to use, it is **not cryptographically secure** for sensitive data:

- **Weak Against Frequency Analysis**: Common letters and patterns can be easily identified
- **Limited Key Space**: Only 25 possible keys make brute force attacks trivial
- **Historical Use Only**: Suitable for learning cryptography concepts

For real-world encryption, use modern algorithms like AES-256.
