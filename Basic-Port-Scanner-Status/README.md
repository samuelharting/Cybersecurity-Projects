## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Educational Purpose**: This tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only
- **Simulated Results**: Port statuses are generated algorithmically, not from actual network scans
- **No Real Scanning**: This application does not perform actual network port scanning
- **Legal Compliance**: Always ensure you have permission before scanning any network

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Enter a valid IP address (IPv4 format)
2. Click "Scan Ports" or press Enter
3. Wait for the scan to complete
4. Review the results and summary

### Input Validation
- IP addresses must be in valid IPv4 format
- Examples: `192.168.1.1`, `10.0.0.1`, `8.8.8.8`
- Invalid IPs will show an error message
